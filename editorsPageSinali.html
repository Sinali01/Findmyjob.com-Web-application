					<div class="about">
                    I’m a past pupil of Musaeus College and currently following an undergraduate degree in Robert Gordan University.

					I chose Artificial Intelligence and Data science for my higher education to fulfill my dream which is to build a robot someday. At the same time I’m very curious about what’s happening in Artificial Intelligence, so I want to learn about it more. 

					I enjoy solving problems, troubleshooting issues, and finding solutions in a as short time as possible. I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best in my degree.

					The areas I was responsible for was,

                    <li>Main Page</li>
					<li>Navigation Bar</li>
                    <li>JavaScript Quiz</li>
